###**Project Synopsis**

This project is an IDE **specifically** for [ROS][3].  It has only been in development for several weeks, so many features have not yet been implemented, or have only been partially been implemented.  Features will (or in some cases already do) include templates for various publishers and subscribers, refactoring, reconfiguring non-ros/rosbuild projects to catkin projects, syntax highlighting, compilation, debugging and execution, etc.
 

###**Dependencies**

This project utalizes *(or will utalize)* the follow libraries:
- [ROS][3] >= electric *(tested with indigo)*
- [QT][4] >= 4 *(tested with 4.8 and 5.5)*
- [C++X11][5]-dev libraries
- [XTerm][6] *(optional)*

###**Install**

This project is currently pre-alpha, so no installation instructions have been included yet.


###**Future Work**

Since the project is currently pre-alpha, this section is redundent at for the time being.
