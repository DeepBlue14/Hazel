- file/class Directories.cpp only has a framework so far
- clean up splitters in CentralGui.cpp *(right now they are declared as well as instantiated in that class, instead of declared in header file as instance variables)*.
- use ```size()``` instead of ```length()```, since the later only works for QT > 4.8
