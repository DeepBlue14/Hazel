###**Project Synopsis**

This program consists of a platform independent terminal--one which will function on both Windows and Unix-like systems.  In addition, it will **translate** commands depending on the environment, i.e. if run on Windows, the user can type in ```ls -l```, and the ```DIR``` command will be executed.  The inverse case will also work.

- Either a UNIX OS with BASH installed *OR* a Windows OS >= XP with Powershell installed
